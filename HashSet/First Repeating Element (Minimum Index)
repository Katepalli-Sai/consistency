🟡 Problem Statement (Explained in Simple Words)

You are given an array of integers.

Some elements may repeat.

👉 Your task is to find the element which repeats and whose FIRST occurrence index is the smallest.

Important Clarification ⚠️

This does NOT mean:

smallest repeating number ❌

first number that repeats while scanning left → right ❌

It means:

Among all repeating elements, pick the one that appeared earliest in the array.

📥 Input Format
n          → size of array
arr[0..n-1] → n integers

📤 Output Format
Print the first repeating element with minimum index
If none exists, print -1

🧪 Example Input
n = 7
arr = [10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6]

🧾 Expected Output
5

🧠 Why Output is 5?

Repeating elements:

5 (first index = 1)

3 (first index = 2)

👉 Minimum index = 1, so answer is 5

🧑‍💻 Your Code (Logic Overview)

You use a HashSet to store elements already seen

You traverse the array from right to left

If an element is already in the HashSet:

It means it appeared before on the left

Update ans

The last updated ans will have the minimum first index

🔍 Dry Run of YOUR Program (Step-by-Step)
Initial State
HashSet = {}
ans = -1

Array
Index:  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Value: [10,  5,  3,  4,  3,  5,  6]

Loop Execution (Right → Left)
i	arr[i]	HashSet Before	Action	ans
6	6	{}	add 6	-1
5	5	{6}	add 5	-1
4	3	{6,5}	add 3	-1
3	4	{6,5,3}	add 4	-1
2	3	{6,5,3,4}	duplicate → ans=3	3
1	5	{6,5,3,4}	duplicate → ans=5	5
0	10	{6,5,3,4}	add 10	5
✅ Final Result
ans = 5


Printed output:

5

🧠 Key Insight (Say This in Interview 🎤)

“By traversing the array from right to left and updating the answer whenever a duplicate is found, the last duplicate stored will always have the smallest first occurrence index.”

🔥 This explanation shows deep understanding.
